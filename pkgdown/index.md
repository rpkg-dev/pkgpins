# pkgpins: Facilitates Results Caching in R Packages Using the Pins Package

[![CRAN Status](https://r-pkg.org/badges/version/pkgpins)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pkgpins){.pkgdown-release}

pkgpins builds upon the [pins](https://pins.rstudio.com/) package and strives to provide R package authors a simple and standardized way to cache results on the filesystem in a suitable user directory.

## How it works

TODO: describe design (separate [user-cache pins board](https://pins.rstudio.com/articles/boards-understanding.html) per pkg and pkg version etc.)

## Predefined parameter labels

There are two predefined parameter labels available in [pkgsnip](https://gitlab.com/salim_b/r/pkgs/pkgsnip) which fit typical use cases of this package. They are intended to be used in `@param` [roxygen2 tags](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/rd.html#functions)[^1] as follows:

``` r
#' @param max_cache_age `r pkgsnip::param_label("max_cache_age")`
#' @param use_cache `r pkgsnip::param_label("use_cache")`
```

The above inline R code will eventually result in this:

``` r
#' @param max_cache_age The duration after which cached results are refreshed (i.e. newly fetched). A valid [lubridate duration][lubridate::as.duration]. Use `Inf` to disable cache expiry. Only relevant if `use_cache = TRUE`.
#' @param use_cache Return cached results if possible. If `FALSE`, results are always newly fetched regardless of `max_cache_age`.
```

## Installation

To install the latest development version of pkgpins, run the following in R:

``` r
if (!("remotes" %in% rownames(installed.packages()))) {
  install.packages(pkgs = "remotes",
                   repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org/")
}

remotes::install_gitlab(repo = "salim_b/r/pkgs/pkgpins")
```

## Usage

The (function) reference is found [here](reference).

## Development

### R Markdown format

This package's source code is written in the [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) file format to facilitate practices commonly referred to as [*literate programming*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming). It allows the actual code to be freely mixed with explanatory and supplementary information in expressive Markdown format instead of having to rely on [`#` comments](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html#Comments) only.

All the `.gen.R` suffixed R source code found under [`R/`](R/) is generated from the respective R Markdown counterparts under [`Rmd/`](Rmd/) using [`pkgpurl::purl_rmd()`](https://pkgpurl.rpkg.dev/dev/reference/purl_rmd.html)[^2]. Always make changes only to the `.Rmd` files -- never the `.R` files -- and then run `pkgpurl::purl_rmd()` to regenerate the R source files.

### Coding style

This package borrows a lot of the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) design philosophies. The R code adheres to the principles specified in the [Tidyverse Design Guide](https://principles.tidyverse.org/) wherever possible and is formatted according to the [Tidyverse Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) (TSG) with the following exceptions:

-   Line width is limited to **160 characters**, double the [limit proposed by the TSG](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#long-lines) (80 characters is ridiculously little given today's high-resolution wide screen monitors).

    Furthermore, the preferred style for breaking long lines differs. Instead of wrapping directly after an expression's opening bracket as [suggested by the TSG](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#long-lines), we prefer two fewer line breaks and indent subsequent lines within the expression by its opening bracket:

    ``` r
    # TSG proposes this
    do_something_very_complicated(
      something = "that",
      requires = many,
      arguments = "some of which may be long"
    )

    # we prefer this
    do_something_very_complicated(something = "that",
                                  requires = many,
                                  arguments = "some of which may be long")
    ```

    This results in less vertical and more horizontal spread of the code and better readability in pipes.

-   Usage of [magrittr's compound assignment pipe-operator `%<>%`](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/reference/compound.html) is desirable[^3].

-   Usage of [R's right-hand assignment operator `->`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/assignOps.html) is not allowed[^4].

-   R source code is *not* split over several files as [suggested by the TSG](https://style.tidyverse.org/package-files.html) but instead is (as far as possible) kept in the single file [`Rmd/pkgpins.Rmd`](Rmd/pkgpins.Rmd) which is well-structured thanks to its [Markdown support](#r-markdown-format).

As far as possible, these deviations from the TSG plus some additional restrictions are formally specified in the [lintr configuration file](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr#project-configuration) [`.lintr`](.lintr), so lintr can be used right away to check for formatting issues:

``` r
pkgpurl::lint_rmd()
```

-   R packages that provide a [memoization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) infrastructure. Memoization is suited best for caching [purely functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional_programming) results, i.e.Â caching functions that *always* return the same result for the same arguments (complete statelessness) -- something that's often not the case for functions accessing external APIs.

    There are at least two actively developed memoization packages:

    -   The Tidyverse-style [**memoise**](https://github.com/r-lib/memoise) package.
    -   The [**R.cache**](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/R.cache) package.

-   The R package [**storr**](https://richfitz.github.io/storr/) that acts as a simple object cacher supporting various [storage back ends](https://richfitz.github.io/storr/articles/storr.html#supported-backends). Notable is the [**thor**](https://richfitz.github.io/thor/index.html) back end that combines in-memory-mapping via [LMDB](https://symas.com/lmdb/) with on-disk caching.

[^1]: Support for dynamic inline R code was introduced in [roxygen2 7.1.0](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/03/roxygen2-7-1-0/).

[^2]: This naming convention as well as the very idea to leverage the R Markdown format to author R packages was originally proposed by Yihui Xie. See his excellent [blog post](https://yihui.name/rlp/) for more detailed information about the benefits of literate programming techniques and some practical examples. Note that using `pkgpurl::purl_rmd()` is a less cumbersome alternative to the Makefile approach outlined by him.

[^3]: The TSG [explicitly instructs to avoid this operator](https://style.tidyverse.org/pipes.html#assignment-2) -- presumably because it's relatively unknown and therefore might be confused with the forward pipe operator `%>%` when skimming code only briefly. I don't consider this to be an actual issue since there aren't many sensible usage patterns of `%>%` at the beginning of a pipe sequence inside a function -- I can only think of creating side effects and relying on [R's implicit return of the last evaluated expression](https://rdrr.io/r/base/function.html). Therefore -- and because I really like the `%<>%` operator -- it's usage is welcome.

[^4]: The TSG [explicitly accepts `->` for assignments at the end of a pipe sequence](https://style.tidyverse.org/pipes.html#assignment-2) while Google's R Style Guide [considers this bad practice](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html#right-hand-assignment) because it "makes it harder to see in code where an object is defined". I second the latter.
